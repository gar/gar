### Hi, Iâ€™m Gar! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Elixir and Ruby software engineer with almost 20 years of experience in web development and leading technical projects.

I love the messy work of discovering people's underlying problems so they can be solved. Sometimes these problems can be solved just by talking to the right person, or by bringing clarity to the situation, but it's always fun when they can be solved by code.

If you're looking for someone to join or lead your team I am open for work. Please check out my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BJ7MUKjTnlMRDiNjTw4pAtZOizHIiwUR/view?usp=sharing) and [say hi](mailto:garmorley@gmail.com)!
